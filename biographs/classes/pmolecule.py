    Parameters
    ----------
    structure_file : str
        The path to the structure file of the targeted protein. Three
        structure-file formats are supported: `pdb', `cif', and `ent'.
    water : boolean, (default: False)

    ions : boolean, (default: False)
        If False, ions are removed.

    Attributes
    ----------
    model: Bio.PDB.model
        The structural model of the structure. See www.biopython.org.
    network: networkx:Graph
        The amino acid network of the protein based on a distance
        cutoff (default=5 angs). See :Pmolecule:network: for more info.
    path_to_file: str
        The path to the structural file used to instantiate the class.
